# Docker Network Lab

This project explores various Docker networking setups, including bridge networks, multi-bridge networks, Swarm overlay networks, and advanced networking modes like MacVLAN.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Docker Bridge Network  
- Default network mode that enables communication between containers on the same host.  
- Allows container-to-container communication while isolating from the host network.  

### 2. Multi-Bridge Networks  
- Created multiple bridge networks to isolate container groups.  
- Ensures better traffic segmentation within the host machine.  

### 3. Docker Swarm Overlay Network  
- Configured a **multi-host** overlay network for Docker Swarm nodes.  
- Enables container-to-container communication across different machines.  

### 4. MacVLAN Mode  
- Assigns unique IP addresses to containers, making them appear as separate devices on the LAN.  
- Useful when containers need to communicate with external systems directly.  

### 5. Docker None Network  
- Containers have no network connectivity.  
- Used for security and isolation when no networking is needed.

## Future Work & Enhancements

### 1. Implement IPVLAN for More Efficient L2 Networking  
- Reduce network overhead compared to MacVLAN.  
- Improve compatibility in cloud environments where multiple MAC addresses aren’t allowed.  

### 2. Enable Encrypted Overlay Network in Swarm  
- Enhance security by encrypting traffic between swarm nodes.  
- Prevent eavesdropping on inter-container communication.  

### 3. Optimize Traffic with a Reverse Proxy (Traefik/Nginx)  
- Implement a load balancer to distribute traffic efficiently.  
- Enable automatic service discovery for dynamically changing containers.  

### 4. Improve Service Discovery with Consul or CoreDNS  
- Move beyond Docker’s built-in DNS for better resilience.  
- Enable automatic resolution of services across networks.  

### 5. VLAN-based Isolation for Security  
- Assign different VLANs to container groups for stricter isolation.  
- Improve segmentation of internal and external traffic.  

### 6. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with Cilium  
- Introduce fine-grained security policies using eBPF.  
- Improve network observability and debugging with advanced traffic monitoring.
